# Url-Shortner
URL Shortener using Python
Welcome to the URL Shortener project! This project provides a simple and efficient solution for shortening long URLs into shorter, more manageable links. Whether you're sharing links on social media, sending URLs via email, or optimizing links for tracking purposes, this project offers a convenient way to generate short URLs on-the-fly.

The URL Shortener utilizes Python and a URL shortening service API to shorten URLs quickly and reliably. It supports popular URL shortening services like Bitly, TinyURL, or custom URL shorteners if you have your own service set up. The project is designed to be easy to use and integrate into your existing workflows.

To get started, clone the repository and install any necessary dependencies specified in the requirements file. Next, configure the URL shortening service API credentials or settings in the configuration file. You can then use the provided scripts or functions to generate short URLs programmatically.

The URL Shortener also includes features for expanding short URLs back to their original long URLs, tracking click statistics, and managing shortened links efficiently. It is a versatile tool for managing and optimizing your URLs effectively.

Contributions are welcome! Whether you're interested in adding support for new URL shortening services, improving performance, or enhancing the user interface, we encourage you to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
